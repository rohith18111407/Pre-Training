# Task 2: Basic Filtering and Sorting in SQL

## Objective

The objective of this task is to practice using SQL `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses to filter and sort data from a database table. This task builds on the previous one by retrieving meaningful subsets of data based on specific conditions.

---

## Requirements

- Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on conditions (e.g., specific department or salary range).
- Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the result set by one or more columns.
- Apply multiple filtering conditions using `AND` / `OR`.
