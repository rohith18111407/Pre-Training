REM A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set defined within the execution scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement using the WITH keyword.



REM 1. Non-Recursive CTE

REM Break down a complex query like total salary per department and filtering departments where total salary exceeds a threshold.

REM DeptSalary is a named temporary result set (like a view). The outer query then filters the result using TotalSalary > 150000.


WITH DeptSalary AS (
    SELECT DepartmentID, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY DepartmentID
)
SELECT DepartmentID, TotalSalary
FROM DeptSalary
WHERE TotalSalary > 150000;



REM Alternative (No CTE):

SELECT DepartmentID, TotalSalary
FROM (
    SELECT DepartmentID, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY DepartmentID
) 
WHERE TotalSalary > 150000;
